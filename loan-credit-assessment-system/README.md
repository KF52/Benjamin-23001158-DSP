# XAI Credit Assessment System

### Project Overview
This project aims to build an Explainable AI driven credit assessment system to evaluate the loan applicants' creditworthiness, which enhances transparency, accountability, and regulatory compliance by integrating machine learning for credit scoring and explainable AI techniques to explain the model's decisions. It ultimately helps reduce loan default rates by enabling more informed and responsible lending decisions.

### Objective
üñ•Ô∏è Develop a GUI-based Credit Assessment System, enabling users to:

- Input relevant data for loan application
- View predictions and insights (explanations)

ü§ñ Credit Score Prediction with Machine Learning : 

- Predict the credit score of loan applicants
- Determine the loan eligibility of applicants based on the predicted credit score

üåê Explainable AI Integration - XAI technique (SHAP) to:

- Provide clear explanations for each prediction
- Improve trust and usability of automated decision-making
- Support compliance with financial regulatory requirements

### Tech Stack

Frontend/UI: Bootstrap

Backend: Python Django, FastAPI

ML Models: 

Explainable AI: SHAP
